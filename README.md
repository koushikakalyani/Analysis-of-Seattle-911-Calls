# Analysis-of-Seattle-911-Calls
Analysis on fictional dataset on 911 calls in the city of Seattle

In our fictitious data set, the city of Seattle only receives 911 calls for four reasons - a hot latte spills all over your lap (ouch!), Beavers attack unsuspecting passersbys (watch out for those beavers!), Seal attacks (can't be too careful), and Marshawn Lynch sightings (people get very excited and choose to call 911 for some reason).

Your task is to run some analysis on this data set and extract insights. Please answer the questions to the 
best of your ability - there is some room for interpretation.

Question:

1.A: What is the most common reason for calling 911?
1.B: Display these results graphically
2.A: Please create a graph of the 911 calls using the 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' (graph type is up to you)
(differentiate call type using colors)
2.B: Are there any data points that look mislabeled?
2.C: If we were to use only 'Latitude' and 'Longitude', could we make an intelligent decision
	as to why a resident dialed 911? (In other words, if we take off the labels - can we still determine which
	category a 911 call would most likely fall into? Please describe this algorithm and your reason for choosing it)
2.D: Does the algorithm chosen utilize Euclidean distance? 
	Should we be concerned that 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' are not necessarily Euclidean?
2.E Please display the results of your algorithm, along with the associated code
3: Please display the number of correct categorizations
